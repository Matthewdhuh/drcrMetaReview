Method: the diagnoses from the test group and the control group were compared with diagnoses from the gold standard. For each image, if one or more diagnoses were consistent with those of the gold standard, which means at least one label existed in the intersection of diagnoses from the test group(or the control group)and those from the gold standard, it would be classified as ""image with consistent diagnosis"". Otherwise, it would be classified as ""image without consistent diagnosis"". After above-mentioned steps, the investigators had obtained the number of images with consistent diagnosis in each group. As images with 1-2 labels account for the majority in actual work, the investigators stipulated that each image in both groups could be marked with 3 labels at most in case of invalid improvement in consistent rate owing to multiple selections., through study completion, an average of 1 year",Visionary Intelligence Ltd.,748,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2020-08-10

A LogMAR chart comprises rows of letters and is used by ophthalmologists, optometrists and vision scientists to estimate visual acuity. This chart was developed at the National Vision Research Institute of Australia in 1976, and is designed to enable a more accurate estimate of acuity than do other charts (e.g., the Snellen chart). For this reason, the LogMAR chart is recommended, particularly in a research setting. A Snellen score of 6/6 (20/20), indicating that an observer can resolve details as small as 1 minute of visual angle, corresponds to a LogMAR of 0 (since the base-10 logarithm of 1 is 0); a Snellen score of 6/12 (20/40), indicating an observer can resolve details as small as 2 minutes of visual angle, corresponds to a LogMAR of 0.3 (since the base-10 logarithm of 2 is near-approximately 0.3), and so on.Therefore, a higher logMAR scores mean a worse outcome., baseline, at 1 month and 3 months after the intervention",Cairo University,15,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2018-01-22

The ETDRS chart allows a geometric quantification the participant's visual acuity threshold for images under daylight-conditions of black \& white contrast. Participant scores were reported as Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) units; a more accurate, standardized value equated from the similar acuity charts. Per the clinical evaluation protocol, LogMAR scores of 0.00 - 0.20 are considered ""good/normal visual acuity scores""; total range of 0.00 - 1.00. Scores are reported as averaged values, according to each respective group of participants and time-point from which the measurements were collected (i.e. baseline, 3-months, etc...).

Exclusion criteria included LogMAR scores greater than, or equal to, 0.30 (equivalent to visual acuity of 20/40 or worse)., Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months|Mean Changes in Contrast Sensitivity (CS), Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) was measured using the CSV-1000E device and measurements were analyzed as logCS units (logarithm of Contrast Sensitivity). The device measures both high- and low-contrast sensitivity (participant's ability to discern size and contrast) within a detection task, and reported as a response-curve. The curve compares the lowest contrast-level for a specific-sized target (across four spatial frequencies; per the manufacturer). Thus, the logCS unit of Contrast Sensitivity, is inversely related to the target's contrast level (displayed by the device). All measurements are reported as averaged values within each group, according to their respective time-frame within the study.

Normal LogCS scores for adults aged 50-75 years old, in ascending order of spatial frequency (3, 6, 12, and 18), are (1.56 +/- 0.15), (1.80 +/- 0.165), (1.50 +/- 0.15), and (0.93 +/- 0.25). Values were utilized for scale, as recommended by the manufacturer/protocol., Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months|Mean Changes in Dark Adaptation Recovery (DAR), DAR measurements were collected using the AdaptDx adaptometer, to identify the participant's impaired dark adaptation threshold value (in response to low-light condition sensitivity). The device's software reported each patient's sensitivity-value over units of time (minutes), and were recorded as units of Rod Intercept Time. Similarly, measurements reported from each group were an averaged value amongst participant groups at each time-point of collection.

According to the manufacturing protocol, a Rod Intercept Time of 6.5 minutes was determined to be the cut-off value for part of the inclusion criteria into treatment groups. Previous studies have demonstrated that scores equal to, or greater than, 6.5 minutes are indicative of early-AMD, and those less than 6.5 minutes are considered normal Rod Intercept values., Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months|Mean Changes in Macular Pigment Optical Density (MPOD), MPOD levels were measured by heterochromatic flicker photometry, using the MapCatSF device. MPOD (Macular Pigment Optical Density) measurements represent the level of light absorption by the macular pigment within the central retina, and provide measurements related to macular carotenoid densities. Measurements were reported as LogMAR units (total range of 0.00 to 1.00), as determined by the manufacture software program. Averaged values were reported within each group, at each time-point of collection.

MPOD values between 0.22 - 0.44 logMAR units have been determined to be middle-range MPOD levels; average value in the USA approximately 0.35. Measurements between (0.0 - 0.21) were considered low-MPOD levels, and those between (0.45 - 1.0) were considered high-MPOD levels.

Each subject was seated with his or her forehead on a head rest at a viewing distance of 40cm. The subject read each sentence aloud and indicated whether it made sense by responding true or false. Reading speed was calculated using an algorithm similar to that used for the MNRead test. The number of words read correctly was divided by the time required to read the sentence to yield a measure of reading speed in words per minute (wpm). Sentences were displayed at sizes of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 log units above the subject's letter acuity threshold. Five sentences were presented at each font size. We used 105 different sentences so that no sentence was repeated for any subject.

VA was obtained by an ophthalmologic assessment at baseline and every two months until month 24. VA measurements were taken with the patient in a sitting position using a Snellen chart at a testing distance of 6 meters. The scale in Snellen is given in fractional numbers corresponding 20/20 to a normal vision at 20 ft or 6 meters. According to the World Health Organization, the normal vision is to 20/25, severe impairment corresponds to VA worse than 20/200 or legal blindness. Each fraction corresponds to a determined line of the chart in which all letters are correctly identified and the variation or gain is appreciated by the lines gained or lost by each eye.

Improvement means a fraction better than initial, stable is no change in VA and lost is the VA worst than those of baseline., Baseline, 2 months and every 2 months until month 24.|Eyes With Change From Baseline to the End of the Study in Distance Vision According to Categories CIE 10 Based on Lines Seen on the Snellen Chart., Change in Visual Acuity was Measured by the Numbers of Lines seen on the Snellen Chart from baseline to the end of the trial. The measure was obtained by an ophthalmologic assessment on both eyes at the beginning of the study and every two months until month 24 using the best correction. VA measurements (lines in which all letters are correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using a Snellen chart at a testing distance of 6 meters and the variation is appreciated by the lines gained or lost by each eye. The measure in Snellen is given in fractional numbers. Each fraction corresponds to a determined line of the chart corresponding VA 20/20 or 6/6 to a normal vision at 20 ft or 6 meters. The range of normal vision according to the WHO is to 20/25 ft or 6/10m, Mild means VA worse than 6/12, Moderate means VA worse than 6/18, Severe means VA worse than 6/60 that is ""legal blindness"". Blindness is considered VA worse than 3/60., 24 months from baseline.|Change From Baseline in the Number of Letters Seen on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Eye Chart, The ETDRS scale of letters is commonly used to report outcomes in AMD, for this reason, this score was chosen to compare outcomes with similar studies. Accepted tables for conversion from Snellen to ETDRS were used. 85 letters are equivalent to 20/20 and 0 letters correspond to 20/200. It can be meaningful to analyze the results in this trial in the context of similar trials using anti-VEGF, or reporting a visual loss in those cases that are not treatable., Baseline and at end of study (up to 2 years)|Number of Eyes That Improved VA From Baseline to End of the Study in Participants With Different Forms of Macular Disease Treated With Acupuncture., ""Improved"" was defined as cases that gained in visual acuity (Note: no minimum of letters was defined).
